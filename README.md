This repository is meant as the future backend for the [Rumble Rush wiki](https://rumblerush.fandom.com/), it does not contain any cheats or provide ways on how to cheat.
The only reason it's open source is because people need to know if the API is trustable.

Please do not copy or use code from this repository to create cheats for the game.
